People saying “Well all it takes is the US accepting Peace”, don’t understand the political situation that is going on in Korea. It’s not just the US influence, or military strategic point that the US has, although that is part of it. It is also tied to the fact that the North has wanted peace and “re-unification” for the past 15-20 year, under a couple conditions:\nSouth Korea severs ties and any alliance with the US.\nThe immediate US removal of troops stationed in the south and removal of US bases.\nNorth Korea will only denuclearize if the US does not just in North Korea, but in Japan as well.\nRe-unification under the North Korean Regime.\nThose have been their demands for the past 15 years. People saying that the US has had plenty chances for discussion if they “just considered peace”, have no idea what they are talking about or are a Russian bot. Pulling out of the South has more implications aside from losing influence in just South Korea. Japan has been more and more worried recently about Russian Influence and China, and moving out of South Korea and troops in Japan would leave our long time ally out to dry.",

They could’ve kept bitching and lobbing the occasional rocket to get humanitarian aid for pretty much the rest of time, so long as China, SK, and the USA all remained more or less the same. Getting into the nuke game changes all that, which is why it was fucking stupid for them to do so, and why I’m shocked China hasn’t been a little more aggressive about getting them to lay the fuck off.",
